Super-Resolution with ESRGAN (TensorFlow)

This project implements a super-resolution model using a modified ESRGAN (Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network) architecture in TensorFlow. The model is designed to upsample low-resolution images to high-resolution outputs while preserving realistic details through perceptual loss computed with a pretrained VGG19 network.
